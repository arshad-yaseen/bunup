# Scaffold with Bunup

Quickly scaffold modern libraries in just 10 seconds with Bun. Powered by Bunup - the fastest bundler available ‚ö°Ô∏è.

- üöÄ **Ready to Code**: Just run the command and start coding - no renaming or setup needed
- üì¶ **Modern Stack**: ESM/CJS formats, TypeScript declarations, and workspace support for monorepos
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Complete Tooling**: Bun-powered development with testing, linting, and formatting
- üö¢ **Automated Releases**: Built-in GitHub Actions for testing and publishing to npm

## Getting Started

You can create a new project by using:

```sh [bun]
bunx bunup@latest --new
```

That's it! You can now start coding.

## Setup for Releases

1. Generate an npm token:
   - Visit [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/), sign in
   - Go to profile ‚Üí Access Tokens ‚Üí Generate New Token (Classic)
   - Name it (e.g. "my-ts-lib publishing"), select "Automation"
   - Generate and copy token

2. Add token to GitHub:
   - Go to repo Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Set name as `NPM_TOKEN` and paste token value

## Development Workflow

After completing the setup, here's how to use your project:

### Common Commands

```sh
bun run dev        # Start development mode with hot reloading
bun run test       # Run test suite
bun run lint       # Check code style and find problems
bun run lint:fix   # Fix linting issues automatically
bun run format:fix # Fix code formatting issues
bun run tsc        # Type check TypeScript code
bun run build      # Build production bundle
```

## CI/CD Workflows

The project comes with three GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **CI**: Runs on pull requests and pushes to main, validating types, linting, and tests
2. **Release**: Triggered by tags, builds and publishes the package to npm with provenance
3. **Issue Management**: Automatically marks issues as stale after 30 days of inactivity

## Releasing Your Package

When you're ready to release your package, simply run:

```sh
bun run release
# or
pnpm release
```

This will:

1. Prompt you for a new version (patch, minor, or major)
2. Update package.json version
3. Create a Git tag
4. Push changes and tag to GitHub

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:

1. Build the package
2. Generate a GitHub release with changelog
3. Publish to npm with provenance

Happy coding!
